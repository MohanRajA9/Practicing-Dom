# Practicing-Dom
 1.This project is practice file for work with the Document object model (DOM) in javascript.
#Description
  1.In this project i create the three elements in HTML file 
                                    a.button for Like Button
                                    b.span for likescount and decresed when it is disliked
                                    c.button for Dislike button
#getElementById
I used the method for accessing the element that i made in HTML file
#addEventListener
I used the method for execute the specific function that i want to run when there is any click takes place

#How it Works
1.when the like button is clicked, that specific code written inside the addEventListener of the likeButton access the innerText of the likescount and add 1 to it
2.when the Dislike button is clicked, that specific code written inside the addEventListener of the DisLikeButton access the innerText of the likescount and add -1 to it
